      <p class="info-content">Hello! Welcome to my channel! This channel is to display my work and my journey as a software engineer! I aspire to create and develop a space on the internet where techie and hacker culture can thrive and flurish -- bridging networking and social media into one platform; based around the spirit of <a class="hacker-manifesto-link" href="http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html">The Hacker Manifesto</a> and the <a class="hacker-ethic-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker Ethic</a> as well. Since coding is first my most beloved hobby, my projects shown here are done by me; just for fun. Be sure to head over to <a class="libcasa-link" href="https://liberta.casa/">Libcasa</a> to see some cool stuff my friends and i maintain for fun! If you are interested in checking out some professional work that I have done; check out <a class="klout-link" href="https://kloutmachine.com/">KloutMachine</a> as I was a front end software engineer there. I currently am working at <a class="truecast-link" href="https://truecast.io/">Truecast</a>, please check them out as well to see what cool projects and technology I am a part of. If you have any questions; please feel free to reach out via any of the methods beow! See you later, Space Samurai!~</p>
